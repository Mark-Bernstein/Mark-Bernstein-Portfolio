        Mark graduated from Cal State University of San Marcos and received a Bachelor's Degree in Visual and Performing
        Arts. He decided to go back to school to pursue something he felt to be much more stimulating. After taking some
        time to think about his future, he realized that he had such a strong connection for learning about and using
        new technology. He thought to himself:{" "}
        <em>
          "How can I fuse all of the experience with software and creativity I have developed by majoring in Arts and
          Technology?"
        </em>{" "}
        Then it hit him ‚Äì software engineering! He then decided to study computer science at San Diego Mesa College for
        2 years. After completing all of the courses required to receive the Programming Certificate of Performance, and
        finishing with a 3.89 GPA, his sights were set. He took a major leap towards his dream career by joining the
        UCSD Coding Bootcamp. After successfully completing the bootcamp and receiving the Certificate of Completion, he
        was excited to take his newly learned skills into the real world and continue his learning indefinitely in the
        ever-evolving field.

        He then landed his first Software Engineering position at Mindera Software Craft and worked for big name clients
        such as FanDuel and TVG.{" "}

        In his free time, he loves to play guitar, make electronic music, go to the beach, play volleyball, and spend
        time with friends and family. He is 30 years young and was born in San Diego, California. He enjoys traveling to
        new destinations whenever given the chance. No matter the destination, he always yearns for knowledge and new
