                Mark graduated from Cal State University of San Marcos and received a Bachelor's Degree in Visual and Performing Arts. He decided to go back to school to pursue something he felt to be much more stimulating.  After taking some time to think about his future, he realized that he had such a strong connection for learning about and using new technology. He thought, how can I fuse all of the experience with software and creativity I have developed by majoring in Arts and Technology? Then it hit him â€“ software engineering! He then decided to study computer science at San Diego Mesa College for 2 years. After completing all the courses required to receive the Programming Certificate of Achievement, and finishing with a 3.89 GPA, his sights were set. He took a major leap towards his dream career by joining the UCSD Coding Bootcamp. Now that he has successfully completed the bootcamp and received the Certificate of Completion, he  is excited to take his newly learned skills into the real world and continue his learning indefinitely in such an evolving field.                </p>
