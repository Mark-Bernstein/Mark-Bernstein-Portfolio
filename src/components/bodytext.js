            After attending Cal State University of San Marcos and receiving a Bachelor's Degree in
            Visual and Performing Arts, I decided to go back to school again and pursue something I
            felt to be much more challenging: programming. I then studied computer science at San Diego Mesa College
            for 2 years with a 3.8GPA. My last major step was deciding to take my learning to the next level
            by joining the UCSD Coding Bootcamp.
            In my free time, I love to play guitar, make electronic music, go to the beach, and play
            volleyball, and of course spend time with friends and family.
            I am 28 years young and I was born in San Diego, California.
            Although that is where I still currently live, I do enjoy traveling to new destinations
            whenever given the chance.
